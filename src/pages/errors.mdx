### Upload Error - RequestTimeTooSkewed
![](../assets/images/aws-errors/AWS-RequestTimeTooSkewed-Error.png)

This bug has occured for some users running Windows 10 and is typically caused by a mismatch in your computers system time and the time on the AWS server.

One way you can check is by running the below in the terminal:

```bash
$ curl http://s3.amazonaws.com -v 
$ date -u 
```

The first command will return the time on the AWS server, and the second command will return the time on your computer. If the times are off by more than **15 minutes**, you'll need to resynchronize your system's clock to resolve the problem.
