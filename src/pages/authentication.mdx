## Authentication

In order to make reqeuests to the API, you'll need to get your `sync-labs-api-key`. After you [create an account](https://app.synclabs.so/signup) and login, navigate to the `Api Keys` page.

From there, you can copy, create or revoke your API keys.

1. Open the profile drop down menu
