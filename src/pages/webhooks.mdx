## Webhooks

Webhooks provide immediate notifications upon the completion of video generation.

### Video Generation

To use a webhook, specify the `webhookUrl` parameter when generating a video.

Once the generation job completes or fails, a POST request will be sent to the `webhookUrl` with the details of the completed job:

```bash
{
  "result": data,
  "error": "Error message",
}
```

<Callout emoji="â„¹">
  Ensure your webhook URL is open to POST requests and properly handles them.
</Callout>

Data will be returned regardless of the status of the job. The error field will return `null` if the job completed successfully.

Webhooks simplify your workflow by eliminating the need for frequent status inquiries. You can continue other tasks while waiting for a webhook notification.
