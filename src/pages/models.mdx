## Models

At Sync Labs, we are proud to offer a range of cutting-edge lip-syncing models, each designed to meet different needs and challenges in the world of video generation. From our stable and reliable `sync-1` model to the experimental and advanced `sync-1.5-beta`, we've got you covered for a variety of scenarios. Here's a closer look at our current offerings:

### Sync-1: The Reliable Workhorse

The `sync-1` model is the cornerstone of our lip-syncing technology. Think of it as the Toyota Corolla of lip-sync models â€“ reliable, versatile, and efficient. 

**Key Features:**
- **Stable Build:** The most recent and stable version of our lip-syncing architecture.
- **Adaptive Resolution:** Generates at 1080p and 25fps by default, but can adjust based on your input needs.
- **Versatility:** Excellently handles a wide range of scenarios, including side profiles, various lighting conditions, and diverse subjects.
- **Consistent Quality:** Provides reasonable outputs for most use cases, making it a go-to choice for general purposes.

### Sync-1.5-Beta: The Cutting Edge Experiment

The `sync-1.5-beta` is our experimental venture, pushing the boundaries of lip-sync technology. Comparable to the BMW M2, it's a model that symbolizes innovation and high performance, albeit with some specific use-case limitations.

**Key Features:**
- **Experimental Build:** Derived from our latest experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures.
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** Approximately 40% better lip-sync accuracy compared to `sync-1`.
- **Reduced Artifacts:** Significantly minimizes bounding box artifacts for a cleaner output.
- **Faster Performance:** Delivers results about 20% faster than the `sync-1` model.
- **Use-Case Specific:** While extremely promising, it may not perform as well with side angles and rapid pose changes.

Each of these models represents our commitment to innovation and quality in the field of video generation technology. Whether you need a reliable solution for a wide array of content or are looking to experiment with the latest advancements, Sync Labs has a model to suit your needs.
