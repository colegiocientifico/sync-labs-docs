## How to upgrade Subscription

To upgrade your subscription, go to the [Sync Labs Web App](https://app.synclabs.so/) navigate to the [Subscription](https://app.synclabs.so/subscription) page and select `subscribe` under the tier you're interested in.

This will redirect you to a secure [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) hosted checkout page where you'll be prompted to enter your payment information. Upon completion you'll be redirected to the [Sync Labs Web App](https://app.synclabs.so/).

## Subscription Management

To manage your subscription, go to the [Sync Labs Web App](https://app.synclabs.so/) navigate to the [Subscription](https://app.synclabs.so/subscription) page and select the `manage subscription` button at the top right of the screen.

This will redirect you to a secure [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) hosted billing portal where you can update your payment information, view your billing history, and cancel your subscription.

## Billing Cycles

Billing cycles are based on the date you first signed up for a subscription. For example, if you signed up on the 15th of the month, your billing cycle will renew on the 15th of each month.

## Overage Charges

If you exceed your monthly generation limit, you can continue to access the service by allowing overage charges.

This can be done by going to the [Sync Labs Web App](https://app.synclabs.so/), navigating to the [Subscription](https://app.synclabs.so/subscription) page and toggling on the `allow overages` option under the `subscription` section.

When overages are enabled and you exceed your monthly generation limit, you will automatically be charged `$30` for `30 additional minutes of generation`.

You can disable overages at any time by toggling off the `allow overages` option.

## FAQs

### Is this a recurring payment?

Yes, our billing cycle is monthly. You have the flexibility to cancel or update your subscription at any point without any additional fees, ensuring you are not locked into a long-term commitment.

### What exactly are credits?

Credits are the currency used within our platform, where one credit equates to one frame of video generation (i.e. a 1 minutes video at 25 fps would cost 1500 credits). Credits will automatically replenish every month, allowing you continuous access to our services.

### Do credits rollover?

Subscription credits expire at the end of each billing cycle and do not rollover. You'll receive a fresh set of subscription credits at the beginning of each new billing cycle.

Overage credits, however, will rollover to the next billing cycle only. Any unused overage credits after that period will expire.

### Canceling a subscription

You can cancel your subscription at any time by going to the [Sync Labs Web App](https://app.synclabs.so/), navigating to the [Subscription](https://app.synclabs.so/subscription) page and selecting the `manage subscription` button at the top right of the screen.

### Pre-paid customers

If you paid for credits before the subscription model was introduced and are having issues with accessing your credits, email us at [prady@synclabs.so](mailto:prady@synclabs.so).
